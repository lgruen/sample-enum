*Abstract:* Low discrepancy sequences, which are based on
radical inversion, expose an intrinsic stratification.  New algorithms are presented to
efficiently enumerate the points of the Halton and (t,s)-sequences per stratum.  This
allows for consistent and adaptive integro-approximation as for example in image
synthesis.
